# Snowball Fight Minigame
Snowball fight minigame for Game Design Workshop Spring '25.

Use WASD or Arrow Keys to move

Use Spacebar to throw snowballs

If you get hit, you lose!

I designed a variety of enemies that spawn and move back and forth / up and down within a certain range, and spawn a variety projectiles.
The player throws snowballs behind them in the opposite direction they're moving.
